## Features

    Choose between running a ping sweep or proceeding directly to Nmap.
    IP Sweeper Wizard prompts for the first 3 octets (e.g., 192.168.10.), then performs a ping scan from 192.168.10.1 to 192.168.10.255.
    Upon completion, a file is saved as ipsweep.<IP range>.txt in the user's current working directory (e.g., ipsweep.192.168.10.txt).
    Option to run an Nmap scan against the discovered IPs.
    Multiple Nmap options available:
        Timing options (-T0 to -T6)
        host scanning options (-Psauye)
        Script scanning options (-Sstunxfwncv)
        Operating system enumeration (-O)
        IP or Hostname options (192.168.20.5),(www.website.com)
        Decoy scanning options (-D RND:5,10,15,20)
        Top ports (--top-ports 5 to 65535)
        Output file options (-oNXGA)
        Show final nmap command before running
    Note: NMAP's --script (scanning options) when used with this script assume you have a good understanding of how to use.
