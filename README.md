## Features

- Program will ask for first 3 octects if not provided when running script. example: ipsweep 192.168.10
- After ipsweep is done it will save to current folder under ipsweep.192.168.10.txt.
- Next it will ask you if you would like to run a full nmap port scan against found ip addresses.
- If yes then it will append all information in the same file it read the ip's from.
