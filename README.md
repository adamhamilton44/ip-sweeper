## Features

1. Choose between running a ping sweep or proceeding directly to Nmap.
   - IP Sweeper Wizard prompts for the first 3 octets (e.g., 192.168.10.), then performs a ping scan from 192.168.10.1 to 192.168.10.255.
   - Upon completion, a file is saved as ipsweep.<ip>.txt in the user's current working directory (e.g., ipsweep.192.168.10.txt).
2. Option to run an Nmap scan against the discovered IPs.

3. Multiple Nmap options available:
   1. Timing options (-T0 to -T6)
   2. Host scanning options (-Psauye)
   3. Script scanning options (-Sstunxfwncv)
   4. Operating system enumeration (-O)
   5. IP or Hostname options (192.168.20.5),(www.website.com)
   6. Decoy scanning options (-D RND:5,10,15,20)
   7. Top ports (--top-ports 5 to 65535)
   8. Output file options (-oNXGA)
   9. Show final nmap command and ask user before running
* Note: Using the --script (scripts.nse) assumes you have a good understanding of nmap's script engine usage.
